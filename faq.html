      <div class="faq-content margin-b20">
        <h4> How much time do I need to spend for the GATE preparation?</h4><br>
        <p>It actually depends on various parameters like your educational background, your learning ability, and your current work environment. But on average if you can spend around 300 to 500 hours watching the videos and revising what you have learnt, you will stand a chance even if you are starting from scratch. All said and done, we really encourage you to spend as much time as possible without taking any chances. It is always better to give everything you got if you want to achieve it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-content margin-b20">
        <h4> How many months should I take to complete the preparation? Should I spread the hours over many months or can I do it in a couple of months?</h4><br>
        <p>Again it varies from person to person. We have even seen people prepare for only one month and got a good score in GATE. But, we suggest that you spread your preparation over as many months as possible so that the concepts will have enough time to sink into your brain.</p>

      <div class="faq-content margin-b20">
        <h4> Is coaching very important to crack GATE and get into IITs?</h4><br>
        <p>It is just like a sport where a coach will help you cut short your learning time using his experience. Ravindra has helped many students achieve great success with his experience. Coaching will definitely help you save lot of time and avoid lots of mistakes. You might hear some people saying that you can crack GATE with out coaching but it is estimated that nearly 20000 students are taking GATE CS after taking coaching from some coaching centres. If you are preparing only for one or two years and if you are not taking coaching, it is like running a race while others are on motor bikes. People who are suggesting that you prepare on your own are not going to take GATE on your behalf. It is your life and we suggest that you do not take any chances.</p>
